    <p>Fried potatoes are a delicious and easy-to-make dish that can be enjoyed as a snack or side dish. Here's a simple recipe to make crispy fried potatoes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel potatoes. Cut them into thin slices or cubes, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the potato slices to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they are golden brown and crispy, flipping occasionally for even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the fried potatoes from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Season the fried potatoes with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your crispy fried potatoes!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Experiment with different seasonings and dipping sauces to customize your fried potatoes to your taste!</p>
